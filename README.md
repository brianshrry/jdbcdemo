With this employee portal for a bakery, the admin will be able to see all employee information,
if he can get in, that is. I either don't remember the password and/or I'm pretty confident
there's something wrong with the configuration of my PC making it needlessly difficult to
get in or to run this application. I'm turning this in with a screenshot of the error Eclipse
gave me. I followed the demonstrations very closely, so it should run successfully if a connection
can be established.
